		The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with <b>demons</b>. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies.  It easts you, staring with your bottom.  <u>I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats</u>.  Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I want.  No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me.

		Risk the pain, it is your nature.  Oh my god! Did it sing? Easy as really difficult pie.  I dislike that Anya. <i>She's newly human and strangely literal</i>. Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher.  One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality.  See, morbid and creepiflying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like.

		There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world.  A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die.  But sometimes a man rises from the darkness.  Sometimes, the pit sends something back.
